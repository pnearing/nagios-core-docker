To create an ssh key pair for NagiosQL:
=======================================

Remote system:
1. Create an user (like nagiosql_usr)

Local system
2. Create a path for the ssh keys
# mkdir /etc/nagiosql/ssh
2. Create a key pair (only rsa is supported!)
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -b 4096
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): /etc/nagiosql/ssh/id_rsa
-> empty passphrase!

3. Copy the key on the remote system
# ssh-copy-id -i /etc/nagiosql/ssh/id_rsa/id_rsa.pub nagiosql_usr@remote-system

4. Check the permissions (read access for apache user)
# chown wwwrun /etc/nagiosql/ssh/id_rsa

5. Check the login on the remote system:
# ssh -i /etc/nagiosql/ssh/id_rsa nagiosql_usr@remote-system
-> Login without a password should be possible!

6. In NagiosQL GUI - go to Administration -> Domain and edit the domain data of your remote system:
6.1. Select SSH/SFTP as Method
6.2. Fill in nagiosql_usr as User
6.3. Fill in /etc/nagiosql/ssh/ as Directory of the key pair (without id_rsa)!


Callback Error
==============

If you get a callback error when connecting to the remote system (variant SSH public key), the file
id_rsa may not be in PEM format. Try a conversion with:
# ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f /etc/nagiosql/ssh/id_rsa
-> empty passphrase!


Using passwort authentication (not recommended)
===============================================

If you are using ssh2 with user/password - you have to enable PasswordAuthentication in your sshd_config:
PasswordAuthentication yes


Installing SSH2 Module for PHP
==============================

1. Install pecl extension from distribution (probably part of php5-devel)							

2. Install libssh2 devel from distribution

3. # pecl install ssh2
   or
   # pecl install ssh2-beta 
   (Use predefined values -> return)
   
4. Add ssh2.so to your php.ini:
   extension=ssh2.so
